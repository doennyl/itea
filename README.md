### The furniture store Kata

This Kata will take place in a `furniture store`.
The application will have different parts in this context. For example the `checkout` functionality.

With every Kata you will learn more principles and how to make code better and more readable.
The principles are all taken from the [Clean Code Developer](https://clean-code-developer.com/) website.

For every Kata we will have two Branches. One is the starting point of the Kata and the other will be one possible solution.
Every Kata Branch will have a `.md` file where the acceptance criteria is written.
You should start by the first point. Write your code/tests and then continue with the second point.

You will find your first task in the branch `01_red_grade_dry`

Endpoints:

`localhost:9000/checkout`

## Prerequisites
* Java 17
